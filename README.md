## Password Manager
This code provides a simple way to store and protect passwords using encryption. It uses the Fernet module from the cryptography library to encrypt and decrypt the passwords, which are stored in the "passwords.txt" file.

## Usage
To use the password manager, you need to have the cryptography library installed. You can install it using pip:

Copy code
pip install cryptography
The first time you run the password manager, you need to generate an encryption key and save it to a file called "key.key". This can be done by uncommenting and running the write_key() function at the top of the script.

To run the password manager, simply execute the script:

Copy code
python password_manager.py
You will then be prompted to choose a mode:

To insert a new password, type insert and follow the prompts.
To view existing passwords, type visualize.
To lock or unlock the password file, type lock or unlock respectively.
To quit the password manager, type q.

## Security
The security of the passwords depends on the strength of the encryption key. It is important to keep the key file secure and not share it with anyone.

## Warning
This password manager is for educational purposes only and is not intended for use in production environments. It is provided as-is without any warranty or guarantee of security. Use at your own risk.
